# barebin - a simple pastebin-like application

What this project is:

* a pet project with the goal of learning how Go works
* a simple tool that is meant to do one job and do it well

What this project isn't:

* something that I will actively maintain in the future
* a bug-free stable production-ready blazing fast webapp
* a social network

## Features

* text hosting (configurable maximum size, syntax highlighting)
* users (sign-up, login, privacy settings)
* search (filters, title/body keywords)
* ...
* that's about it?
